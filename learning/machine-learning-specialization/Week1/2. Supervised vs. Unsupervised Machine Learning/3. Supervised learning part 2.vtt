1
00:00:02.177 --> 00:00:08.866
So supervised learning algorithms learn to
predict input, output or X to Y mapping.

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.574
And in the last video you saw
that regression algorithms,

3
00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:17.568
which is a type of supervised learning
algorithm learns to predict numbers out

4
00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:20.081
of infinitely many possible numbers.

5
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:24.879
There's a second major type of supervised
learning algorithm called a classification

6
00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:25.603
algorithm.

7
00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:28.935
Let's take a look at what this means.

8
00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:35.102
Take breast cancer detection as
an example of a classification problem.

9
00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.819
Say you're building
a machine learning system so

10
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:41.389
that doctors can have a diagnostic
tool to detect breast cancer.

11
00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:46.753
This is important because early detection
could potentially save a patient's life.

12
00:00:46.753 --> 00:00:51.784
Using a patient's medical records
your machine learning system tries to

13
00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:57.311
figure out if a tumor that is a lump is
malignant meaning cancerous or dangerous.

14
00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:02.171
Or if that tumor, that lump is benign,
meaning that it's just

15
00:01:02.171 --> 00:01:06.586
a lump that isn't cancerous and
isn't that dangerous?

16
00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:10.882
Some of my friends have actually been
working on this specific problem.

17
00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:15.552
So maybe your dataset has
tumors of various sizes.

18
00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:19.478
And these tumors are labeled
as either benign,

19
00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:23.504
which I will designate in
this example with a 0 or

20
00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:28.529
malignant, which will designate
in this example with a 1.

21
00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:33.075
You can then plot your data
on a graph like this where

22
00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:38.047
the horizontal axis represents
the size of the tumor and

23
00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:42.171
the vertical axis takes
on only two values 0 or

24
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:48.023
1 depending on whether the tumor
is benign, 0 or malignant 1.

25
00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:48.873
One reason that this is different from
regression is that we're trying to predict

26
00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:49.471
only a small number of possible outputs or
categories.

27
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:55.210
In this case two possible

28
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.308
outputs 0 or 1,

29
00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:04.510
benign or malignant.

30
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.142
This is different from regression
which tries to predict any number,

31
00:02:10.142 --> 00:02:14.637
all of the infinitely many
number of possible numbers.

32
00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:18.768
And so the fact that there
are only two possible outputs is

33
00:02:18.768 --> 00:02:21.275
what makes this classification.

34
00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:25.140
Because there are only
two possible outputs or

35
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.708
two possible categories in this example,

36
00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:32.887
you can also plot this data
set on a line like this.

37
00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:38.128
Right now, I'm going to use two
different symbols to denote

38
00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:43.677
the category using a circle an O
to denote the benign examples and

39
00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:47.395
a cross to denote the malignant examples.

40
00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:51.724
And if new patients walks in for
a diagnosis and

41
00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:57.052
they have a lump that is this size,
then the question is,

42
00:02:57.052 --> 00:03:02.838
will your system classify this
tumor as benign or malignant?

43
00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:07.815
It turns out that in classification
problems you can also have more than two

44
00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:09.874
possible output categories.

45
00:03:09.874 --> 00:03:14.594
Maybe you're learning algorithm can
output multiple types of cancer

46
00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:17.474
diagnosis if it turns out to be malignant.

47
00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:22.497
So let's call two different types
of cancer type 1 and type 2.

48
00:03:22.497 --> 00:03:27.271
In this case the average would
have three possible output

49
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:29.864
categories it could predict.

50
00:03:29.864 --> 00:03:34.157
And by the way in classification,
the terms output classes and

51
00:03:34.157 --> 00:03:37.804
output categories are often
used interchangeably.

52
00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:42.255
So what I say class or
category when referring to the output,

53
00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.097
it means the same thing.

54
00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:50.914
So to summarize classification
algorithms predict categories.

55
00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:52.754
Categories don't have to be numbers.

56
00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:56.321
It could be non numeric for example,

57
00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:01.737
it can predict whether a picture
is that of a cat or a dog.

58
00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:07.016
And it can predict if a tumor is benign or
malignant.

59
00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:12.930
Categories can also be numbers like 0,
1 or 0, 1, 2.

60
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.932
But what makes classification
different from regression when

61
00:04:17.932 --> 00:04:23.312
you're interpreting the numbers
is that classification predicts

62
00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:29.253
a small finite limited set of possible
output categories such as 0, 1 and

63
00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:34.469
2 but not all possible numbers
in between like 0.5 or 1.7.

64
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:40.601
In the example of supervised
learning that we've been looking at,

65
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:45.023
we had only one input value
the size of the tumor.

66
00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:51.086
But you can also use more than one
input value to predict an output.

67
00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:55.773
Here's an example,
instead of just knowing the tumor size,

68
00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:59.391
say you also have each
patient's age in years.

69
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:04.941
Your new data set now has two inputs,
age and tumor size.

70
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:11.315
What in this new dataset we're going to
use circles to show patients whose tumors

71
00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:17.327
are benign and crosses to show the
patients with a tumor that was malignant.

72
00:05:17.327 --> 00:05:23.079
So when a new patient comes in, the doctor
can measure the patient's tumor size and

73
00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.394
also record the patient's age.

74
00:05:25.394 --> 00:05:26.972
And so given this,

75
00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:32.605
how can we predict if this patient's
tumor is benign or malignant?

76
00:05:32.605 --> 00:05:37.956
Well, given the day said like this,
what the learning algorithm might do

77
00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:44.105
is find some boundary that separates out
the malignant tumors from the benign ones.

78
00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:48.898
So the learning algorithm has to
decide how to fit a boundary line

79
00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:50.423
through this data.

80
00:05:50.423 --> 00:05:54.681
The boundary line found by the learning
algorithm would help the doctor with

81
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:55.620
the diagnosis.

82
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.795
In this case the tumor is
more likely to be benign.

83
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:05.385
From this example we have seen how
to inputs the patient's age and

84
00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:07.060
tumor size can be used.

85
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.995
In other machine learning problems often
many more input values are required.

86
00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:17.813
My friends who worked on breast cancer
detection use many additional inputs,

87
00:06:17.813 --> 00:06:22.047
like the thickness of the tumor clump,
uniformity of the cell size,

88
00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:24.469
uniformity of the cell shape and so on.

89
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:29.585
So to recap supervised learning
maps input x to output y,

90
00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:35.673
where the learning algorithm learns
from the quote right answers.

91
00:06:35.673 --> 00:06:41.197
The two major types of supervised learning
our regression and classification.

92
00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:45.761
In a regression application like
predicting prices of houses, the learning

93
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:50.618
algorithm has to predict numbers from
infinitely many possible output numbers.

94
00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:55.494
Whereas in classification the learning
algorithm has to make a prediction of

95
00:06:55.494 --> 00:06:58.802
a category,
all of a small set of possible outputs.

96
00:06:58.802 --> 00:07:01.880
So you now know what is
supervised learning,

97
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.288
including both regression and
classification.

98
00:07:05.288 --> 00:07:06.902
I hope you're having fun.

99
00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:10.468
Next there's a second major
type of machine learning

100
00:07:10.468 --> 00:07:12.694
called unsupervised learning.

101
00:07:12.694 --> 00:07:15.560
Let's go on to the next
video to see what that is
