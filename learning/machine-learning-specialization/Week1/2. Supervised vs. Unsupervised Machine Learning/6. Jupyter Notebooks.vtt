00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.645
From the videos, you've seen
supervised learning and

2
00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:10.000
unsupervised learning and
also examples of both.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
For you to more deeply
understand these concepts,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.560
I'll like to invite you
in this class to see,

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.930
learn and maybe
later write codes

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.615
yourself to implement
these concepts.

7
00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:24.480
The most widely used tool
by machine learning and

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.910
data science practitioners
today is the Jupyter Notebook.

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.980
This is the default
environments that a lot of us

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.585
use to code up and experiment
and try things out.

11
00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:38.210
In this class, right here
in your web browser,

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.060
you build a user Jupyter
Notebook environment

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.515
to test out some of these
ideas for yourself as well.

14
00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:48.245
This is not some made up
simplified environment,

15
00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:50.479
this is the exact
same environments,

16
00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.345
the exact same tool,
the Jupyter Notebook

17
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.860
that developers are using in

18
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.890
many large countries right now.

19
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.180
One type of lab that
you see throughout

20
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.130
this class are optional labs,

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.340
which are ones you can
open and run one line at

22
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.235
a time with usually no need
to write any code yourself.

23
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:13.175
Optional labs are
designed to be very easy

24
00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:16.370
and I can guarantee you
will get full marks,

25
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.535
every single one of them
because there are no marks.

26
00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:21.650
All you need to do is open it up

27
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.220
and just run the
code we've provided.

28
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.150
By reading through and running

29
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.740
the code in the optional labs,

30
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.255
you see how machine
learning code runs.

31
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:35.090
You should complete
them relatively

32
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.085
quickly just by running it

33
00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:39.875
one line at a time
from top to bottom.

34
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.440
Optional labs are
completely optional

35
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.550
so you don't have to do

36
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.370
them at all if you
don't want to,

37
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.915
but I hope you will take a look

38
00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:49.550
because running through them

39
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.960
will give you a deeper feel,

40
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.015
give you a little
bit more experience

41
00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:55.115
with what machine
learning algorithms,

42
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.265
what machine learning
code actually looks like.

43
00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.410
Starting next week,
there'll also be

44
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.630
some practice labs
which would give you

45
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.610
an opportunity to write
some of that code

46
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.190
yourself but we'll get
to that next week.

47
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.250
Don't worry about it for

48
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.325
now and I hope you
just go through

49
00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:12.230
the next optional lab and get

50
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.960
through the rest of the
content for this week.

51
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.260
Let's take a look at an
example of a notebook.

52
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.860
Here's what you see when you

53
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.870
go to the first optional lab.

54
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.820
Feel free to scroll up and
down and browse and mouseover

55
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.620
the different menus and take

56
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.520
a look at the different
options here.

57
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.450
You might notice that there are

58
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.160
two types of these blocks,

59
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.080
also called cells in

60
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.475
the notebook and there
are two types of cells.

61
00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:43.365
One is what's called
a Markdown cell,

62
00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:46.035
which means a bunch of tax.

63
00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:48.260
Here you can actually
edit the text

64
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.785
if you don't like the
text that we wrote,

65
00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:54.540
but this is text that
describes the code.

66
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.245
Then there's a
second type of block

67
00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.900
or cell which looks like this,

68
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.335
which has a code cell.

69
00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:04.770
Here, we've already
provided the code

70
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.160
and if you want to
run this code cell,

71
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.470
hitting Shift Enter will run

72
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.695
the code in this code
cell, and by the way,

73
00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:14.735
if you click on a markdown cell,

74
00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:17.300
so this showing all
this formatting,

75
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.780
go ahead and hit Shift
Enter on your keyboard as

76
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.805
well and that will also convert

77
00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.765
back to this nicely
formatted text.

78
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:29.300
This optional lab shows
some common Python code,

79
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.010
so you can go ahead and run this

80
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.835
afterwards in your
own Jupyter notebook.

81
00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:36.360
When you jump into this
notebook yourself,

82
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.270
what I'd like you
to do is select

83
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.320
the cells and hit Shift Enter.

84
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.010
Read through the code,
see if it makes sense,

85
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.100
try to make a prediction
about what you

86
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.710
think this code
would do and then

87
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.080
hit Shift Enter and

88
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.465
then see what the
code actually does,

89
00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:54.980
and if you like it,

90
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.125
feel free to go in
and edit the code,

91
00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:00.415
change the code, and then
run it and see what happens.

92
00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:02.010
If you haven't played in

93
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.010
the Jupyter Notebook
environment for,

94
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.840
I hope you become
more familiar with

95
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.330
Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

96
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.790
I spend a lot of hours
playing around in

97
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.470
Jupyter notebooks and so I

98
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.680
hope you have fun with them too.

99
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.090
After that, I look
forward to seeing you

100
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.160
in the next video
where we'll take

101
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.070
the supervised learning
problem as start to flesh

102
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.535
out our first supervised
learning algorithm.

103
00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:26.960
I hope that will
be fun to you and

104
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.190
look forward to
seeing you there.
