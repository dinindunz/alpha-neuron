00:00:02.103 --> 00:00:03.797
After supervised learning,

2
00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:08.003
the most widely used form of machine
learning is unsupervised learning.

3
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:13.535
Let's take a look at what that means,
we've talked about supervised learning and

4
00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:16.551
this video is about unsupervised learning.

5
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.695
But don't let the name uncivilized for
you,

6
00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:24.754
unsupervised learning is I think just
as super as supervised learning.

7
00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:28.555
When we're looking at supervised
learning in the last video recalled,

8
00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:32.243
it looks something like this in
the case of a classification problem.

9
00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:37.538
Each example, was associated with
an output label y such as benign or

10
00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:43.493
malignant, designated by the poles and
crosses in unsupervised learning.

11
00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:48.773
Were given data that isn't
associated with any output labels y,

12
00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:55.214
say you're given data on patients and
their tumor size and the patient's age.

13
00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:59.733
But not whether the tumor was benign or
malignant, so

14
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:03.257
the dataset looks like this on the right.

15
00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:07.723
We're not asked to diagnose
whether the tumor is benign or

16
00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:11.652
malignant, because we're
not given any labels.

17
00:01:11.652 --> 00:01:16.304
Why in the dataset, instead,
our job is to find some structure or

18
00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:20.716
some pattern or just find
something interesting in the data.

19
00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:22.818
This is unsupervised learning,

20
00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:27.856
we call it unsupervised because we're
not trying to supervise the algorithm.

21
00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:32.067
To give some quote right answer for
every input, instead,

22
00:01:32.067 --> 00:01:37.223
we asked the our room to figure out
all by yourself what's interesting.

23
00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:41.216
Or what patterns or
structures that might be in this data,

24
00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.417
with this particular data set.

25
00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:47.056
An unsupervised learning algorithm,
might decide that

26
00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:51.918
the data can be assigned to two different
groups or two different clusters.

27
00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:58.550
And so it might decide, that there's
one cluster what group over here,

28
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.130
and there's another cluster or
group over here.

29
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.671
This is a particular type of unsupervised
learning, called a clustering algorithm.

30
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:13.647
Because it places the unlabeled data,
into different clusters and

31
00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:17.151
this turns out to be used
in many applications.

32
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.841
For example,
clustering is used in google news,

33
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.870
what google news does
is every day it goes.

34
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.784
And looks at hundreds of thousands of
news articles on the internet, and

35
00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:31.719
groups related stories together.

36
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.728
For example, here is a sample from
Google News, where the headline of the top

37
00:02:36.728 --> 00:02:41.831
article, is giant panda gives birth to
rear twin cubs at Japan's oldest zoo.

38
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:46.566
This article has actually caught my eye,
because my daughter loves pandas and so

39
00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.664
there are a lot of stuff panda toys.

40
00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:54.070
And watching panda videos in my house,
and looking at this,

41
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.589
you might notice that below this
are other related articles.

42
00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.874
Maybe from the headlines alone,

43
00:03:01.874 --> 00:03:05.633
you can start to guess what
clustering might be doing.

44
00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:11.249
Notice that the word
panda appears here here,

45
00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:16.577
here, here and here and
notice that the word

46
00:03:16.577 --> 00:03:21.481
twin also appears in all five articles.

47
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:25.692
And the word Zoo also appears
in all of these articles, so

48
00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:29.309
the clustering algorithm
is finding articles.

49
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:34.080
All of all the hundreds of thousands of
news articles on the internet that day,

50
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.161
finding the articles that mention similar
words and grouping them into clusters.

51
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:43.857
Now, what's cool is that this clustering
algorithm figures out on his own which

52
00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.463
words suggest, that certain
articles are in the same group.

53
00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:52.133
What I mean is there isn't an employee at
google news who's telling the algorithm to

54
00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:54.128
find articles that the word panda.

55
00:03:54.128 --> 00:03:57.500
And twins and
zoo to put them into the same cluster,

56
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.783
the news topics change every day.

57
00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:04.508
And there are so many news stories,
it just isn't feasible to people

58
00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:08.837
doing this every single day for
all the topics that use covers.

59
00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:14.188
Instead the algorithm has to figure
out on his own without supervision,

60
00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:17.622
what are the clusters
of news articles today.

61
00:04:17.622 --> 00:04:20.573
So that's why this clustering algorithm,

62
00:04:20.573 --> 00:04:23.773
is a type of unsupervised
learning algorithm.

63
00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:28.249
Let's look at the second example
of unsupervised learning

64
00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.568
applied to clustering genetic or DNA data.

65
00:04:31.568 --> 00:04:35.076
This image shows a picture
of DNA micro array data,

66
00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:38.189
these look like tiny
grids of a spreadsheet.

67
00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:44.724
And each tiny column represents
the genetic or DNA activity of one person,

68
00:04:44.724 --> 00:04:50.651
So for example, this entire Column
here is from one person's DNA.

69
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:54.379
And this other column
is of another person,

70
00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.816
each row represents a particular gene.

71
00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:03.442
So just as an example, perhaps this
role here might represent a gene that

72
00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:09.640
affects eye color, or this role here is
a gene that affects how tall someone is.

73
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.580
Researchers have even found a genetic
link to whether someone dislikes certain

74
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.015
vegetables, such as broccoli, or
brussels sprouts, or asparagus.

75
00:05:19.015 --> 00:05:23.588
So next time someone asks you why
didn't you finish your salad,

76
00:05:23.588 --> 00:05:28.003
you can tell them,
maybe it's genetic for DNA micro race.

77
00:05:28.003 --> 00:05:32.058
The idea is to measure how much
certain genes, are expressed for

78
00:05:32.058 --> 00:05:33.720
each individual person.

79
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.793
So these colors red, green, gray,
and so on, show the degree to

80
00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:44.446
which different individuals do, or
do not have a specific gene active.

81
00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:48.862
And what you can do is then run
a clustering algorithm to group

82
00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:51.986
individuals into different categories.

83
00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:57.911
Or different types of people like maybe
these individuals that group together,

84
00:05:57.911 --> 00:06:00.533
and let's just call this type one.

85
00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:04.742
And these people
are grouped into type two,

86
00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:08.851
and these people are groups as type three.

87
00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:12.634
This is unsupervised learning,
because we're not telling the algorithm in

88
00:06:12.634 --> 00:06:16.254
advance, that there is a type one
person with certain characteristics.

89
00:06:16.254 --> 00:06:18.972
Or a type two person with
certain characteristics,

90
00:06:18.972 --> 00:06:21.824
instead what we're saying
is here's a bunch of data.

91
00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:25.171
I don't know what the different
types of people are but

92
00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:28.243
can you automatically
find structure into data.

93
00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:32.052
And automatically figure out whether
the major types of individuals,

94
00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:36.574
since we're not giving the algorithm the
right answer for the examples in advance.

95
00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:41.259
This is unsupervised learning,
here's the third example,

96
00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:47.215
many companies have huge databases of
customer information given this data.

97
00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:50.327
Can you automatically
group your customers,

98
00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:56.243
into different market segments so that you
can more efficiently serve your customers.

99
00:06:56.243 --> 00:07:00.551
Concretely the deep learning dot AI team
did some research to better understand

100
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:02.553
the deep learning dot AI community.

101
00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:06.354
And why different individuals
take these classes,

102
00:07:06.354 --> 00:07:11.459
subscribed to the batch weekly newsletter,
or attend our AI events.

103
00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:15.047
Let's visualize the deep
learning dot AI community,

104
00:07:15.047 --> 00:07:18.409
as this collection of
people running clustering.

105
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:24.181
That is market segmentation found
a few distinct groups of individuals,

106
00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:30.242
one group's primary motivation is
seeking knowledge to grow their skills.

107
00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:32.933
Perhaps this is you, and so that's great,

108
00:07:32.933 --> 00:07:38.043
a second group's primary motivation is
looking for a way to develop their career.

109
00:07:38.043 --> 00:07:40.819
Maybe you want to get a promotion or
a new job, or

110
00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:45.135
make some career progression if this
describes you, that's great too.

111
00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:49.975
And yet another group wants to stay
updated on how AI impacts their

112
00:07:49.975 --> 00:07:54.209
field of work, perhaps this is you,
that's great too.

113
00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:59.092
This is a clustering that our team used
to try to better serve our community

114
00:07:59.092 --> 00:08:01.237
as we're trying to figure out.

115
00:08:01.237 --> 00:08:05.867
Whether the major categories of learners
in the deeper and community, So

116
00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:10.211
if any of these is your top motivation for
learning, that's great.

117
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:15.052
And I hope I'll be able to help you on
your journey, or in case this is you, and

118
00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:19.615
you want something totally different
than the other three categories.

119
00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:24.086
That's fine too, and I want you to know,
I love you all the same, so

120
00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.688
to summarize a clustering algorithm.

121
00:08:26.688 --> 00:08:30.144
Which is a type of unsupervised
learning algorithm,

122
00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:35.385
takes data without labels and tries to
automatically group them into clusters.

123
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:39.278
And so maybe the next time you see or
think of a panda,

124
00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:42.211
maybe you think of clustering as well.

125
00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:47.032
And besides clustering, there are other
types of unsupervised learning as well.

126
00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:48.558
Let's go on to the next video,

127
00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:52.151
to take a look at some other types
of unsupervised learning algorithms.
