1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.240
Machine learning is creating

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.430
tremendous economic value today.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.430
I think 99 percent of
the economic value

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.870
created by machine
learning today

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.955
is through one type
of machine learning,

6
00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:14.025
which is called
supervised learning.

7
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.470
Let's take a look
at what that means.

8
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.900
Supervised machine learning or

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.075
more commonly,
supervised learning,

10
00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:24.480
refers to algorithms
that learn x to

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.590
y or input to output mappings.

12
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.770
The key characteristic of
supervised learning is

13
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.225
that you give

14
00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.680
your learning algorithm
examples to learn from.

15
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.730
That includes the right
answers, whereby right answer,

16
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.235
I mean, the correct label
y for a given input x,

17
00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:48.915
and is by seeing
correct pairs of

18
00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:52.850
input x and desired
output label y that

19
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.890
the learning algorithm
eventually learns to

20
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.050
take just the input
alone without

21
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.970
the output label and gives

22
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.185
a reasonably accurate prediction
or guess of the output.

23
00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:05.620
Let's look at some examples.

24
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.010
If the input x is

25
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.985
an email and the output
y is this email,

26
00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:13.590
spam or not spam,

27
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.785
this gives you your spam filter.

28
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:21.120
Or if the input is
an audio clip and

29
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.565
the algorithm's job is
output the text transcript,

30
00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:29.470
then this is speech recognition.

31
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.770
Or if you want to
input English and have

32
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.515
it output to
corresponding Spanish,

33
00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:37.495
Arabic, Hindi,
Chinese, Japanese,

34
00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:39.445
or something else translation,

35
00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:42.385
then that's machine translation.

36
00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:46.000
Or the most lucrative form
of supervised learning

37
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.110
today is probably used
in online advertising.

38
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.560
Nearly all the large
online ad platforms have

39
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.950
a learning algorithm that
inputs some information about

40
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.815
an ad and some
information about you

41
00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:01.825
and then tries to figure out

42
00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.120
if you will click
on that ad or not.

43
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.970
Because by showing
you ads they're

44
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.970
just slightly more
likely to click on,

45
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.910
for these large
online ad platforms,

46
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.710
every click is revenue,

47
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.360
this actually drives a lot of

48
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.070
revenue for these companies.

49
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.055
This is something I once
done a lot of work on,

50
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.665
maybe not the most
inspiring application,

51
00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.560
but it certainly has a
significant economic impact

52
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.195
in some countries today.

53
00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:28.870
Or if you want to build
a self-driving car,

54
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.180
the learning algorithm
would take as input

55
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.715
an image and some
information from

56
00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:35.665
other sensors such as a radar or

57
00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:39.775
other things and then try
to output the position of,

58
00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:41.320
say, other cars so that

59
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.700
your self-driving car can

60
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.230
safely drive around
the other cars.

61
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.565
Or take manufacturing.

62
00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:49.190
I've actually done
a lot of work in

63
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.835
this sector at learning AI.

64
00:02:51.835 --> 00:02:54.050
You can have a learning
algorithm takes as

65
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.395
input a picture of a
manufactured product,

66
00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:01.415
say a cell phone that just
rolled off the production line

67
00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.680
and have the learning
algorithm output

68
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.845
whether or not
there is a scratch,

69
00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:08.715
dent, or other defect
in the product.

70
00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:11.600
This is called visual
inspection and it's helping

71
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.340
manufacturers reduce or prevent

72
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.410
defects in their products.

73
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.750
In all of these applications,

74
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.465
you will first train your
model with examples of

75
00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:23.480
inputs x and the right answers,

76
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.670
that is the labels y.

77
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.340
After the model has
learned from these input,

78
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.365
output, or x and y pairs,

79
00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:33.065
they can then take a
brand new input x,

80
00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:34.505
something it has
never seen before,

81
00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.110
and try to produce the

82
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.815
appropriate
corresponding output y.

83
00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:44.420
Let's dive more deeply
into one specific example.

84
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.565
Say you want to predict

85
00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:49.730
housing prices based on
the size of the house.

86
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.280
You've collected
some data and say

87
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.390
you plot the data and
it looks like this.

88
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.485
Here on the horizontal axis

89
00:03:57.485 --> 00:03:59.825
is the size of the
house in square feet.

90
00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:01.730
Yes, I live in the United States

91
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.155
where we still use square feet.

92
00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:06.160
I know most of the world
uses square meters.

93
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.430
Here on the vertical axis is
the price of the house in,

94
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.820
say, thousands of dollars.

95
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.850
With this data, let's say a
friend wants to know what's

96
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.095
the price for their
750 square foot house.

97
00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.485
How can the learning
algorithm help you?

98
00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:25.130
One thing a learning algorithm

99
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.615
might be able to do is say,

100
00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:28.280
for the straight line to

101
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.700
the data and reading
off the straight line,

102
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.350
it looks like your
friend's house could

103
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.225
be sold for maybe about,

104
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:38.320
I don't know, $150,000.

105
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.670
But fitting a
straight line isn't

106
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.830
the only learning
algorithm you can use.

107
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.390
There are others that could work

108
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.280
better for this application.

109
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.160
For example, routed and
fitting a straight line,

110
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.460
you might decide that it's
better to fit a curve,

111
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.320
a function that's slightly more

112
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.010
complicated or more complex
than a straight line.

113
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.950
If you do that and make
a prediction here,

114
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.645
then it looks like, well,

115
00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:07.725
your friend's house could be
sold for closer to $200,000.

116
00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:11.225
One of the things you
see later in this class

117
00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:14.240
is how you can decide whether
to fit a straight line,

118
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.620
a curve, or

119
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.310
another function that is even
more complex to the data.

120
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.870
Now, it doesn't seem
appropriate to pick

121
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.440
the one that gives your
friend the best price,

122
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.790
but one thing you
see is how to get

123
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.400
an algorithm to systematically

124
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.680
choose the most
appropriate line or

125
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.445
curve or other thing
to fit to this data.

126
00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:38.770
What you've seen
in this slide is

127
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.335
an example of
supervised learning.

128
00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:43.660
Because we gave the
algorithm a dataset in

129
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.910
which the so-called
right answer,

130
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.980
that is the label or

131
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.220
the correct price y is given
for every house on the plot.

132
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.820
The task of the learning
algorithm is to

133
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.295
produce more of
these right answers,

134
00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:59.440
specifically predicting what is

135
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.640
the likely price for

136
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.445
other houses like
your friend's house.

137
00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:06.275
That's why this is
supervised learning.

138
00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:08.750
To define a little
bit more terminology,

139
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.940
this housing price prediction is

140
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.920
the particular type of
supervised learning

141
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.635
called regression.

142
00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:17.030
By regression, I
mean we're trying

143
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.115
to predict a number from

144
00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:21.410
infinitely many possible numbers

145
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.590
such as the house
prices in our example,

146
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.035
which could be 150,000 or

147
00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:33.645
70,000 or 183,000 or any
other number in between.

148
00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:37.020
That's supervised
learning, learning input,

149
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.620
output, or x to y mappings.

150
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.020
You saw in this
video an example of

151
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.620
regression where the task
is to predict number.

152
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.845
But there's also a
second major type of

153
00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:52.190
supervised learning problem
called classification.

154
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.890
Let's take a look at what
that means in the next video.
