00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
What is machine learning?

2
00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.685
In this video, you'll learn
the definition of what it is

3
00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.060
and also get a sense of when
you might want to apply it.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.920
Let's take a look together.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.260
Here's a definition of what is

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.950
machine learning that is
attributed to Arthur Samuel.

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.510
He defined machine learning

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.310
as the field of study that gives

9
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.990
computers the ability to learn

10
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.330
without being
explicitly programmed.

11
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.140
Samuel's claim to fame was
that back in the 1950s,

12
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.510
he wrote a checkers
playing program.

13
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.070
The amazing thing about

14
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.990
this program was
that Arthur Samuel

15
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.485
himself wasn't a very
good checkers player.

16
00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:40.710
What he did was he had
programmed the computer

17
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
to play maybe tens of thousands
of games against itself.

18
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.320
By watching what social
support positions

19
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.810
tend to lead to wins
and what positions

20
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.930
tend to lead to losses the
checkers plane program

21
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.550
learned over time what are

22
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.190
good or bad suport positions by

23
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.250
trying to get a good and
avoid bad positions,

24
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.415
this program learned to get
better and better at playing

25
00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:04.890
checkers because
the computer had

26
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.970
the patience to play

27
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.175
tens of thousands of
games against itself.

28
00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:09.390
It was able to get

29
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.090
so much checkers
playing experience that

30
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.865
eventually it became a
better checkers player

31
00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:17.010
than also, Samuel himself.

32
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.080
Now throughout these videos,

33
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.135
besides me trying to
talk about stuff,

34
00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:23.415
I occasionally ask
you a question

35
00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.265
to help make sure you
understand the content.

36
00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:28.310
Here's one about what happens if

37
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.215
the computer had played
far fewer games.

38
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:32.670
Please take a look and pick

39
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.380
whichever you think
is the better answer.

40
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.755
Thanks for looking at the quiz.

41
00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:43.110
If you had selected

42
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.450
this answer would have

43
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.360
made it worse then
you got the right.

44
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.760
In general, the
more opportunities

45
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.815
you give a learning
algorithm to learn,

46
00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:54.675
the better it will perform.

47
00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:57.810
If you didn't select the
correct answer the first time,

48
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.310
that's totally okay too.

49
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.740
The point of these
questions isn't

50
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.910
to see if you can get them

51
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.500
all correctly on the first try.

52
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.510
These questions are
here just to help

53
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.880
you practice the concepts
you are learning.

54
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.320
Arthur Samuel's
definition was a rather

55
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.110
informal one but in
the next two videos,

56
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.330
we'll dive deeper
together into what are

57
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.010
the major types of machine
learning algorithms?

58
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.610
In this course, you learn about

59
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.785
many different
learning algorithms.

60
00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:27.740
The two main types of
machine learning are

61
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.310
supervised learning and
unsupervised learning.

62
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.320
We'll define what
these terms mean

63
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.055
more in the next
couple of videos.

64
00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.160
Of these two,
supervised learning

65
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
is the type of machine
learning that is used most in

66
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.010
many real-world
applications and has

67
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.680
seen the most rapid
advancements and innovation.

68
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.785
In this specialization,

69
00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:53.265
which has three
courses in total,

70
00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:54.940
the first and
second courses will

71
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.515
focus on supervised learning,

72
00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:59.725
and the third will focus
on unsupervised learning,

73
00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:02.925
recommender systems, and
reinforcement learning.

74
00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:05.900
By far, the most used types of

75
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.525
learning algorithms today
are supervised learning,

76
00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:11.885
unsupervised learning,
and recommender systems.

77
00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.850
The other thing we're
going to spend a lot of

78
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.890
time on in this specialization

79
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.165
is practical advice for
applying learning algorithms.

80
00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.580
This is something I feel
pretty strongly about.

81
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.580
Teaching about learning
algorithms is like giving

82
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.030
someone a set of tools
and equally important,

83
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.490
so even more important
to making sure you

84
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.145
have great tools is making sure

85
00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.095
you know how to apply them

86
00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:39.080
because like is it is
somewhere where it

87
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.335
gives you a state-of-the-art hammer

88
00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:44.055
or a state-of-the-art hand drill
and say good luck.

89
00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:45.470
Now you have all
the tools you need

90
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.120
to build a three-story house.

91
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.045
It doesn't really work like that

92
00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:52.010
and so too, in machine learning,

93
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.900
making sure you
have the tools is

94
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.820
really important
and so is making

95
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.800
sure that you know how to apply

96
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.805
the tools of machine
learning effectively.

97
00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:02.655
That's what you
get in this class,

98
00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:03.980
the tools as well as the

99
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.575
skills to apply
them effectively.

100
00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:09.110
I regularly visit
with friends and

101
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.525
teams in some of the
top tech companies,

102
00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:15.200
and even today I see experienced
machine learning teams

103
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.830
apply machine learning
algorithms to some problems,

104
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.810
and sometimes they've
been going at it for

105
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.455
six months without much success.

106
00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:25.295
When I look at what
they're doing,

107
00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:27.620
I sometimes feel like
I could have told them

108
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.990
six months ago that the
current approach won't work

109
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.850
and there's a
different way of using

110
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.500
these tools that will give

111
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.410
them a much better
chance of success.

112
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.310
In this class, one of

113
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.830
the relatively unique
things you learn is

114
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.230
you learn a lot about
the best practices for

115
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.690
how to actually
develop a practical,

116
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.030
valuable machine
learning system.

117
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.800
This way, you're less likely to

118
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.390
end up in one of
those teams that

119
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.065
end up losing six months going
in the wrong direction.

120
00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:56.720
In this class, you
gain a sense of how

121
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.890
the most skilled machine

122
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.720
learning engineers
build systems.

123
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.010
I hope you finish

124
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.130
this class as one of
those very rare people in

125
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.230
today's world that know how to

126
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.960
design and build serious
machine learning systems.

127
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.525
That's machine learning.

128
00:05:11.525 --> 00:05:13.085
In the next video,

129
00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:15.350
let's look more
deeply at what is

130
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.405
supervised learning and also

131
00:05:17.405 --> 00:05:19.580
what is unsupervised learning.

132
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.405
In addition, you'll learn

133
00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:23.420
when you might want
to use each of them,

134
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.730
supervised and
unsupervised learning.

135
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.500
I'll see you in the next video.
