1
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.660
In this class, you'll learn about

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.190
the state of the art and also

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.480
practice implementing

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.830
machine learning
algorithms yourself.

5
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.290
You'll learn about the most

6
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.180
important machine
learning algorithms,

7
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.920
some of which are exactly

8
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.720
what's being used in large AI or

9
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.385
large tech companies
today and you

10
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.780
get a sense of what is the
state of the art in AI.

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.590
Beyond learning the algorithms
though, in this class,

12
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.470
you'll also learn all the
important practical tips

13
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.170
and tricks for making
them perform well.

14
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.090
You get to implement
them and see

15
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.665
how they work for yourself.

16
00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:39.665
Why is machine learning
so widely used today?

17
00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.750
Machine Learning had grown up as

18
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.020
a sub-field of AI or
artificial intelligence.

19
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.350
We wanted to build
intelligent machines.

20
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.860
It turns out that there are

21
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.560
a few basic things that we
could program a machine to do,

22
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.305
such as how to find the
shortest path from a to b,

23
00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:55.810
like in your GPS.

24
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.255
But for the most part, we just
did not know how to write

25
00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.130
an explicit program to

26
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.915
do many of the more
interesting things,

27
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.910
such as perform web search,

28
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.010
recognize human speech, diagnose

29
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.060
diseases from X-rays or
build a self-driving car.

30
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.565
The only way we knew
how to do these things

31
00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:17.545
was to have a machine
learn to do it by itself.

32
00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:19.820
For me, when I founded

33
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.890
and was leading the
Google Brain Team,

34
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.395
I worked on problems
like speech recognition,

35
00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:26.030
computer vision for Google Maps,

36
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.550
Street View images
and advertising,

37
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.620
or leading AI Baidu,

38
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.025
I worked on everything from
AI for augmented reality

39
00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:35.915
to combating payment fraud

40
00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.245
to leading a
self-driving car team.

41
00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:40.830
Most recently, at landing.AI,

42
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.950
AI Fund and
Stanford University,

43
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.530
I'm beginning to work on AI
applications in the factory,

44
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.915
large-scale agriculture,
health care,

45
00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:49.985
e-commerce, and other problems.

46
00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.280
Today, there are
hundreds of thousands,

47
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.555
perhaps millions of people

48
00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:55.460
working on machine
learning applications who

49
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.930
could tell you similar stories

50
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.205
about their work with
machine learning.

51
00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:01.220
When you've learned
these skills,

52
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.550
I hope that you too will
find the great fun to dabble

53
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.590
in exciting different
applications

54
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.585
and maybe even
different industries.

55
00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:10.640
In fact, I find it
hard to think of

56
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.650
any industry that
machine learning is

57
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.180
unlikely to touch in

58
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.465
a significant way now
or in the near future.

59
00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:20.765
Looking even further
into the future,

60
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.835
many people, including me,

61
00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:25.310
are excited about
the AI dream of

62
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.480
someday building machines as
intelligent as you or me.

63
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.150
This is sometimes called

64
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.705
Artificial General
Intelligence or AGI.

65
00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:36.470
I think AGI has
been overhyped and

66
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.200
we're still a long way
away from that goal.

67
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.150
I don't know. It'll take

68
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.380
50 years or 500 years
or longer to get there.

69
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.994
But mostly AI researchers

70
00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:47.960
believe that the best way to get

71
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.040
closer toward that goal is by
using learning algorithms.

72
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.200
Maybe ones that take
some inspiration

73
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.015
from how the human brain works.

74
00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:58.265
You also hear a
little more about

75
00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:01.640
this Quest for AGI
later in this course.

76
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.355
According to a
study by McKinsey,

77
00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:07.820
AI and machine learning
is estimated to create

78
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.460
an additional 13
trillion US dollars

79
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.625
of value annually
by the year 2030.

80
00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.220
Even though machine learning
is already creating

81
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.370
tremendous amounts of value
in the software industry,

82
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.185
I think there could be

83
00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:23.990
even vastly greater
value that has yet to be

84
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.825
created outside the
software industry

85
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.580
in sectors such as retail,

86
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.975
travel, transportation,

87
00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:33.850
automotive, materials
manufacturing, and so on.

88
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.010
Because of the massive
untapped opportunities

89
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.155
across so many
different sectors,

90
00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:42.230
today there is a vast
unfulfilled demand

91
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.290
for this skill set.

92
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.580
That's why this is
such a great time to

93
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.925
be learning about
machine learning.

94
00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:52.380
If you find machine learning
applications exciting,

95
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.685
I hope you stick with
me through this class.

96
00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:58.130
I can almost
guarantee that you'll

97
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.060
find mastering these
skills worthwhile.

98
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.200
In the next video, we'll look at

99
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.550
a more formal definition of
what is machine learning.

100
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.710
And we'll begin to talk about

101
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.850
the main types of

102
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.699
machine learning
problems and algorithms.

103
00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.560
You pick up some of

104
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.010
the main machine learning
terminology and start to get

105
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.530
a sense of what are the
different algorithms

106
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.710
and when each one
might be appropriate.

107
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.710
So let's go on to
the next video.
