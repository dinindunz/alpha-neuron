00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.440
In the last video, you
saw one visualization of

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.100
the cost function J
of w or J of w, b.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.885
Let's look at some further

4
00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:12.060
richer visualizations
so that you can get

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.650
an even better intuition

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.125
about what the cost
function is doing.

7
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.270
Here is what we've seen so far.

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.665
There's the model, the
model's parameters w and b,

9
00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.725
the cost function J of w and b,

10
00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.410
as well as the goal
of linear regression,

11
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.770
which is to minimize the
cost function J of w

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.025
and b over parameters w and b.

13
00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:36.660
In the last video,

14
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.570
we had temporarily set b to

15
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.070
zero in order to simplify
the visualizations.

16
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.215
Now, let's go back to
the original model with

17
00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.475
both parameters w and b

18
00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.250
without setting b
to be equal to 0.

19
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.480
Same as last time,

20
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900
we want to get a
visual understanding

21
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.050
of the model function, f of x,

22
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.700
shown here on the left,

23
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.560
and how it relates to the
cost function J of w,

24
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.155
b, shown here on the right.

25
00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:10.205
Here's a training set of
house sizes and prices.

26
00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:12.620
Let's say you pick
one possible function

27
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.480
of x, like this one.

28
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.130
Here, I've set w
to 0.06 and b to

29
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.235
50. f of x is 0.06
times x plus 50.

30
00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:26.720
Note that this is not

31
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.655
a particularly good model
for this training set,

32
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.570
is actually a pretty bad model.

33
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.840
It seems to consistently
underestimate housing prices.

34
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.180
Given these values for w
and b let's look at what

35
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.485
the cost function J of
w and b may look like.

36
00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:47.270
Recall what we saw last time
was when you had only w,

37
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.825
because we temporarily set b
to zero to simplify things,

38
00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:55.415
but then we had come up with
a plot of the cost function

39
00:01:55.415 --> 00:02:00.055
that look like this as
a function of w only.

40
00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.505
When we had only
one parameter, w,

41
00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:06.620
the cost function had
this U-shaped curve,

42
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.435
shaped a bit like a soup bowl.

43
00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:10.630
That sounds delicious.

44
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.890
Now, in this housing
price example

45
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.530
that we have on this slide,

46
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.045
we have two parameters, w and b.

47
00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:23.515
The plots becomes a
little more complex.

48
00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:27.320
It turns out that
the cost function

49
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.190
also has a similar
shape like a soup bowl,

50
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.485
except in three dimensions
instead of two.

51
00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:37.210
In fact, depending on
your training set,

52
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.495
the cost function will
look something like this.

53
00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:42.955
To me, this looks
like a soup bowl,

54
00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:45.005
maybe because I'm a
little bit hungry,

55
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.610
or maybe to you it looks like

56
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.475
a curved dinner
plate or a hammock.

57
00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:52.275
Actually that sounds
relaxing too,

58
00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:54.885
and there's your coconut drink.

59
00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:57.340
Maybe when you're done
with this course,

60
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.540
you should treat yourself to

61
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.330
vacation and relax in
a hammock like this.

62
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.555
What you see here is
a 3D-surface plot

63
00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:08.630
where the axes are
labeled w and b.

64
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.305
As you vary w and b,

65
00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:13.585
which are the two
parameters of the model,

66
00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:15.130
you get different values for

67
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.845
the cost function J of w, and b.

68
00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:21.260
This is a lot like
the U-shaped curve

69
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.940
you saw in the last video,

70
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.470
except instead of having

71
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.425
one parameter w as
input for the j,

72
00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:29.479
you now have two parameters,

73
00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.970
w and b as inputs into

74
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.760
this soup bowl or this
hammock-shaped function

75
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.660
J. I just want to point out
that any single point on

76
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.105
this surface represents
some particular choice

77
00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:43.295
of w and b.

78
00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:49.850
For example, if w was minus
10 and b was minus 15,

79
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.800
then the height of the surface

80
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.870
above this point is the value of

81
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.570
j when w is minus 10
and b is minus 15.

82
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.820
Now, in order to look even more

83
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.340
closely at specific points,

84
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.900
there's another way of plotting

85
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.385
the cost function J

86
00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:09.755
that would be useful
for visualization,

87
00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:13.625
which is, rather than using
these 3D-surface plots,

88
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.040
I like to take this
exact same function

89
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.480
J. I'm not changing

90
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.730
the function J at all and

91
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.985
plot it using something
called a contour plot.

92
00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:25.850
If you've ever seen
a topographical map

93
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.250
showing how high
different mountains are,

94
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.840
the contours in a topographical
map are basically

95
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.385
horizontal slices of the
landscape of say, a mountain.

96
00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:40.055
This image is of
Mount Fuji in Japan.

97
00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:42.320
I still remember
my family visiting

98
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.005
Mount Fuji when I
was a teenager.

99
00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:47.125
It's beautiful sights.

100
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.600
If you fly directly
above the mountain,

101
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.585
that's what this
contour map looks like.

102
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.070
It shows all the points,

103
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.150
they're at the same height
for different heights.

104
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.290
At the bottom of this slide
is a 3D-surface plot of

105
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.970
the cost function J.

106
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.325
I know it doesn't look
very bowl-shaped,

107
00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:11.105
but it is actually a bowl
just very stretched out,

108
00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:12.685
which is why it looks like that.

109
00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:14.565
In an optional lab,

110
00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:16.305
that is shortly to follow,

111
00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:19.325
you will be able to see
this in 3D and spin around

112
00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:21.050
the surface yourself
and it'll look

113
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.500
more obviously
bowl-shaped there.

114
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.800
Next, here on the upper
right is a contour plot of

115
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.840
this exact same cost function

116
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.125
as that shown at the bottom.

117
00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:36.605
The two axes on this
contour plots are b,

118
00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:38.070
on the vertical axis,

119
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.075
and w on the horizontal axis.

120
00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:43.685
What each of these ovals,

121
00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:45.560
also called ellipses,

122
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.170
shows, is the center points on

123
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.770
the 3D surface which are
at the exact same height.

124
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.050
In other words, the set
of points which have

125
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.830
the same value for
the cost function J.

126
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.945
To get the contour plots,

127
00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:03.590
you take the 3D surface
at the bottom and you

128
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.010
use a knife to slice
it horizontally.

129
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.490
You take horizontal slices of

130
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.270
that 3D surface and
get all the points,

131
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.350
they're at the same height.

132
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.790
Therefore, each horizontal
slice ends up being shown

133
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.625
as one of these ellipses
or one of these ovals.

134
00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:28.545
Concretely, if you
take that point,

135
00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:32.500
and that point, and that point,

136
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.910
all of these three points have

137
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.000
the same value for
the cost function J,

138
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.745
even though they have
different values for w and b.

139
00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:46.555
In the figure on the upper left,

140
00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:49.225
you see also that
these three points

141
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:52.090
correspond to
different functions,

142
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.850
f, all three of which
are actually pretty

143
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.130
bad for predicting housing
prices in this case.

144
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.610
Now, the bottom of the bowl,

145
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.990
where the cost function
J is at a minimum,

146
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.470
is this point right here,

147
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.440
at the center of this
concentric ovals.

148
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.830
If you haven't seen
contour plots much before,

149
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.725
I'd like you to
imagine, if you will,

150
00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:20.200
that you are flying
high up above

151
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.785
the bowl in an airplane
or in a rocket ship,

152
00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:26.545
and you're looking
straight down at it.

153
00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:28.690
That is as if you set

154
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.345
your computer monitor
flat on your desk

155
00:07:31.345 --> 00:07:33.850
facing up and the bowl shape

156
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.995
is coming directly
out of your screen,

157
00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:37.600
rising above you desk.

158
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.450
Imagine that the bowl
shape grows out of

159
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.330
your computer screen
lying flat like that,

160
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.110
so that each of these ovals have

161
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.900
the same height above
your screen and

162
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.390
the minimum of the bowl is right

163
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.180
down there in the center
of the smallest oval.

164
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.470
It turns out that the
contour plots are

165
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.880
a convenient way to visualize
the 3D cost function J,

166
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.375
but in a way, there's
plotted in just 2D.

167
00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:09.410
In this video, you saw how

168
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.425
the 3D bowl-shaped surface plot

169
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:15.850
can also be visualized
as a contour plot.

170
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.995
Using this visualization too,

171
00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:19.385
in the next video,

172
00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:22.099
let's visualize some
specific choices

173
00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:24.670
of w and b in the
linear regression model

174
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.230
so that you can see how
these different choices

175
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.260
affect the straight line
you're fitting to the data.

176
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.060
Let's go on to the next video.
