00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.690
In this video,
we'll look at what

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.620
the overall process of
supervised learning is like.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
Specifically, you see
the first model of

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.665
this course, Linear
Regression Model.

5
00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.010
That just means fitting a
straight line to your data.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.810
It's probably the most

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.540
widely used learning
algorithm in the world today.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.525
As you get familiar
with linear regression,

9
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:28.215
many of the concepts you
see here will also apply to

10
00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.630
other machine
learning models that

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
you'll see later in
this specialization.

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.820
Let's start with a
problem that you can

13
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.875
address using linear regression.

14
00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.860
Say you want to
predict the price of

15
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.080
a house based on the
size of the house.

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.890
This is the example we've
seen earlier this week.

17
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.060
We're going to use a dataset on

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.270
house sizes and
prices from Portland,

19
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.520
a city in the United States.

20
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.990
Here we have a graph where

21
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.490
the horizontal axis is

22
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.485
the size of the house
in square feet,

23
00:00:57.485 --> 00:00:59.735
and the vertical axis is

24
00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:03.065
the price of a house in
thousands of dollars.

25
00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:04.820
Let's go ahead and plot

26
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.700
the data points for various
houses in the dataset.

27
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.515
Here each data point,

28
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:12.470
each of these little
crosses is a house with

29
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.540
the size and the price that

30
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.170
it most recently was sold for.

31
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.530
Now, let's say you're
a real estate agent in

32
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.235
Portland and you're helping
a client to sell her house.

33
00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:25.170
She is asking you, how

34
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.135
much do you think I can
get for this house?

35
00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:29.000
This dataset might help you

36
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.865
estimate the price
she could get for it.

37
00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:34.265
You start by measuring
the size of the house,

38
00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:38.900
and it turns out that the
house is 1250 square feet.

39
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.660
How much do you think this
house could sell for?

40
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.490
One thing you could do this,

41
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.660
you can build a linear

42
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.465
regression model
from this dataset.

43
00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.360
Your model will fit a
straight line to the data,

44
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.615
which might look like this.

45
00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:55.640
Based on this straight
line fit to the data,

46
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.560
you can see that the house
is 1250 square feet,

47
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.940
it will intersect the
best fit line over here,

48
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.475
and if you trace that to the
vertical axis on the left,

49
00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:09.560
you can see the price
is maybe around

50
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.865
here, say about $220,000.

51
00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:15.020
This is an example of what's

52
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.615
called a supervised
learning model.

53
00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:19.535
We call this supervised learning

54
00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.010
because you are first
training a model by giving

55
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.920
a data that has right
answers because you get

56
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.090
the model examples of

57
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.040
houses with both the
size of the house,

58
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.750
as well as the price that

59
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.835
the model should
predict for each house.

60
00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:34.220
Well, here are the
prices, that is,

61
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.990
the right answers are given

62
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.335
for every house in the dataset.

63
00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.490
This linear regression model is

64
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.190
a particular type of
supervised learning model.

65
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.100
It's called regression model
because it predicts numbers

66
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.250
as the output like
prices in dollars.

67
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.890
Any supervised learning
model that predicts

68
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.610
a number such as 220,000 or

69
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.555
1.5 or negative 33.2

70
00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:03.250
is addressing what's called
a regression problem.

71
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.415
Linear regression is one
example of a regression model.

72
00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:09.410
But there are other models for

73
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.020
addressing regression
problems too.

74
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.270
We'll see some of those later in

75
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.470
Course 2 of this specialization.

76
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.265
Just to remind you,

77
00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.890
in contrast with the
regression model,

78
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.020
the other most common type of

79
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.610
supervised learning model is

80
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.370
called a classification model.

81
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.800
Classification model predicts

82
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.455
categories or
discrete categories,

83
00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:36.725
such as predicting if
a picture is of a cat,

84
00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:38.150
meow or a dog,

85
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.405
woof, or if given
medical record,

86
00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:44.815
it has to predict if a patient
has a particular disease.

87
00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:46.580
You'll see more about

88
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.955
classification models later
in this course as well.

89
00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.500
As a reminder about

90
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.055
the difference between
classification and regression,

91
00:03:54.055 --> 00:03:55.850
in classification, there are

92
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.745
only a small number
of possible outputs.

93
00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:02.345
If your model is recognizing
cats versus dogs,

94
00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.045
that's two possible outputs.

95
00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:08.030
Or maybe you're trying
to recognize any of

96
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.220
10 possible medical
conditions in a patient,

97
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.940
so there's a discrete,

98
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.175
finite set of possible outputs.

99
00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:17.870
We call it classification

100
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.895
problem, whereas in regression,

101
00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:22.070
there are infinitely
many possible numbers

102
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.050
that the model could output.

103
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.940
In addition to visualizing

104
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.770
this data as a plot
here on the left,

105
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.950
there's one other
way of looking at

106
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.680
the data that would be useful,

107
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.395
and that's a data table
here on the right.

108
00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:41.820
The data comprises
a set of inputs.

109
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.640
This would be the
size of the house,

110
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.030
which is this column here.

111
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.870
It also has outputs.

112
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.450
You're trying to
predict the price,

113
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.150
which is this column here.

114
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.460
Notice that the horizontal
and vertical axes

115
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.865
correspond to these two columns,

116
00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:04.850
the size and the price.

117
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.205
If you have, say, 47
rows in this data table,

118
00:05:11.205 --> 00:05:13.290
then there are 47 of

119
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.865
these little crosses on
the plot of the left,

120
00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:22.245
each cross corresponding
to one row of the table.

121
00:05:22.245 --> 00:05:25.395
For example, the first row

122
00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:28.325
of the table is a
house with size,

123
00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:30.960
2,104 square feet,

124
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.250
so that's around here,

125
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.695
and this house is sold for
$400,000 which is around here.

126
00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:45.065
This first row of
the table is plotted

127
00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:48.935
as this data point over here.

128
00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:50.370
Now, let's look at

129
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.440
some notation for
describing the data.

130
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.435
This is notation that you find

131
00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:58.405
useful throughout your
journey in machine learning.

132
00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:00.330
As you increasingly get

133
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.810
familiar with machine
learning terminology,

134
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.860
this would be
terminology they can

135
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.070
use to talk about machine
learning concepts

136
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.500
with others as well
since a lot of

137
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.490
this is quite
standard across AI,

138
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.630
you'll be seeing this notation

139
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.625
multiple times in
this specialization,

140
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.500
so it's okay if you don't

141
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.590
remember everything
for assign through,

142
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.085
it will naturally become
more familiar overtime.

143
00:06:24.085 --> 00:06:28.020
The dataset that you
just saw and that is

144
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.900
used to train the model
is called a training set.

145
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.900
Note that your client's
house is not in

146
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.435
this dataset because
it's not yet sold,

147
00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:41.015
so no one knows
what the price is.

148
00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:43.835
To predict the price of
your client's house,

149
00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:46.740
you first train your
model to learn from

150
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.495
the training set and
that model can then

151
00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:53.005
predict your client's
houses price.

152
00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:56.670
In Machine Learning, the
standard notation to denote

153
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.620
the input here is lowercase x,

154
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.265
and we call this
the input variable,

155
00:07:03.265 --> 00:07:09.005
is also called a feature
or an input feature.

156
00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:13.240
For example, for the first
house in your training set,

157
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.205
x is the size of the house,

158
00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:19.295
so x equals 2,104.

159
00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:22.480
The standard notation to denote

160
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.495
the output variable which
you're trying to predict,

161
00:07:26.495 --> 00:07:29.595
which is also sometimes
called the target

162
00:07:29.595 --> 00:07:34.660
variable, is lowercase y.

163
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.380
Here, y is the
price of the house,

164
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.720
and for the first
training example,

165
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.175
this is equal to 400,

166
00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:48.130
so y equals 400.

167
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.810
The dataset has one row for

168
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.370
each house and in
this training set,

169
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.405
there are 47 rows with

170
00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:03.355
each row representing a
different training example.

171
00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:06.410
We're going to use
lowercase m to

172
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.355
refer it to the total number
of training examples,

173
00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:13.440
and so here m is equal to 47.

174
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.559
To indicate the single
training example,

175
00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:22.075
we're going to use the
notation parentheses x, y.

176
00:08:22.075 --> 00:08:26.425
For the first training
example, (x, y),

177
00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:32.910
this pair of numbers
is (2104, 400).

178
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.290
Now we have a lot of
different training examples.

179
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.345
We have 47 of them in fact.

180
00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:42.775
To refer to a specific
training example,

181
00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:44.215
this will correspond to

182
00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:47.345
a specific row in this
table on the left,

183
00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:49.460
I'm going to use the notation

184
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.085
x superscript in parenthesis,

185
00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:57.280
i, y superscript
in parentheses i.

186
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.020
The superscript tells us that

187
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.860
this is the ith
training example,

188
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.455
such as the first,

189
00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:08.915
second, or third up to the
47th training example.

190
00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:15.525
I here, refers to a
specific row in the table.

191
00:09:15.525 --> 00:09:20.855
For instance, here is
the first example,

192
00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:25.330
when i equals 1 in
the training set,

193
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.340
and so x superscript 1 is

194
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.235
equal to 2,104 and y superscript

195
00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:34.735
1 is equal to

196
00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:41.425
400 and let's add this
superscript 1 here as well.

197
00:09:41.425 --> 00:09:44.910
Just to note, this superscript i

198
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.010
in parentheses is
not exponentiation.

199
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.125
When I write this,

200
00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:52.930
this is not x squared.

201
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.620
This is not x to the power 2.

202
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.270
It just refers to the
second training example.

203
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.920
This i, is just an index into

204
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.205
the training set and refers
to row i in the table.

205
00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:09.740
In this video, you saw what
a training set is like,

206
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.520
as well as a standard notation

207
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.345
for describing
this training set.

208
00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:14.630
In the next video,

209
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.450
let's look at what
rotate to take

210
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.995
this training set that
you just saw and feed it

211
00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:21.040
to learning algorithm so that

212
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.665
the algorithm can
learn from this data.

213
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.450
Let's see that in
the next video.
