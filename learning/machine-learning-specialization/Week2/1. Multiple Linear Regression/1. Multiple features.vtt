00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome back. In this week,

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.845
we'll learn to make
linear regression

3
00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:08.320
much faster and
much more powerful,

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.090
and by the end of this week,

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.665
you'll be two thirds of the way

6
00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:13.645
to finishing this first course.

7
00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.060
Let's start by looking
at the version of

8
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.300
linear regression that look
at not just one feature,

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.615
but a lot of different
features. Let's take a look.

10
00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:26.845
In the original version
of linear regression,

11
00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:29.785
you had a single feature x,

12
00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:33.825
the size of the house and
you're able to predict y,

13
00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.820
the price of the house.

14
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.065
The model was fwb of
x equals wx plus b.

15
00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:46.450
But now, what if you did
not only have the size of

16
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.800
the house as a feature with

17
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.775
which to try to
predict the price,

18
00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:53.244
but if you also knew
the number of bedrooms,

19
00:00:53.244 --> 00:00:56.650
the number of floors and the
age of the home in years.

20
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.390
It seems like this
would give you

21
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.720
a lot more information with
which to predict the price.

22
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.580
To introduce a little
bit of new notation,

23
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.580
we're going to use
the variables X_1,

24
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.000
X_2, X_3 and X_4,

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.195
to denote the four features.

26
00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:16.540
For simplicity, let's introduce

27
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.190
a little bit more notation.

28
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.525
We'll write X subscript j

29
00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:23.005
or sometimes I'll
just say for short,

30
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.980
X sub j, to represent
the list of features.

31
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.575
Here, j will go
from one to four,

32
00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:31.465
because we have four features.

33
00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.910
I'm going to use lowercase

34
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.090
n to denote the total
number of features,

35
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.485
so in this example,

36
00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:40.250
n is equal to 4.

37
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.395
As before, we'll
use X superscript

38
00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:48.165
i to denote the ith
training example.

39
00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:51.760
Here X superscript i is actually

40
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.615
going to be a list
of four numbers,

41
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:59.360
or sometimes we'll call
this a vector that

42
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.405
includes all the features of
the ith training example.

43
00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:07.079
As a concrete example,

44
00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.190
X superscript in parentheses 2,

45
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.450
will be a vector of

46
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.810
the features for the
second training example,

47
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.770
so it will equal
to this 1416, 3,

48
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.670
2 and 40 and technically,

49
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.810
I'm writing these
numbers in a row,

50
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.460
so sometimes this is called

51
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.250
a row vector rather
than a column vector.

52
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.050
But if you don't know
what the difference is,

53
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.910
don't worry about it, it's

54
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.405
not that important
for this purpose.

55
00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:38.035
To refer to a specific feature

56
00:02:38.035 --> 00:02:40.555
in the ith training example,

57
00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:45.425
I will write X superscript
i, subscript j,

58
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:49.230
so for example, X
superscript 2 subscript

59
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.240
3 will be the value
of the third feature,

60
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.160
that is the number of floors in

61
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.140
the second training example and

62
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.325
so that's going
to be equal to 2.

63
00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:04.740
Sometimes in order to
emphasize that this X^2

64
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.540
is not a number but is

65
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.970
actually a list of
numbers that is a vector,

66
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.510
we'll draw an arrow on
top of that just to

67
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.985
visually show that is a
vector and over here as well,

68
00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:21.835
but you don't have to draw
this arrow in your notation.

69
00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:25.880
You can think of the arrow
as an optional signifier.

70
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.680
They're sometimes used just to

71
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.575
emphasize that this is a
vector and not a number.

72
00:03:30.575 --> 00:03:32.900
Now that we have
multiple features,

73
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.175
let's take a look at what
a model would look like.

74
00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:39.325
Previously, this is how
we defined the model,

75
00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.480
where X was a single feature,

76
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.875
so a single number.

77
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.245
But now with multiple features,

78
00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:47.810
we're going to define
it differently.

79
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.085
Instead, the model will be,

80
00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:55.965
fwb of X equals w1x1

81
00:03:55.965 --> 00:04:01.890
plus w2x2 plus w3x3
plus w4x4 plus b.

82
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.855
Concretely for housing
price prediction,

83
00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:10.370
one possible model may be
that we estimate the price

84
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.960
of the house as 0.1 times
X_1, the size of the house,

85
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.315
plus four times X_2,

86
00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:19.545
the number of bedrooms,

87
00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:22.530
plus ten times X_3,
the number of floors,

88
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.600
minus 2 times X_4,

89
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.250
the age of the house
in years plus 80.

90
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.420
Let's think a bit about how you

91
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.535
might interpret
these parameters.

92
00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.620
If the model is
trying to predict

93
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.095
the price of the house
in thousands of dollars,

94
00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:40.520
you can think of
this b equals 80 as

95
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.800
saying that the base
price of a house

96
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.320
starts off at maybe $80,000,

97
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.790
assuming it has no size,

98
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.615
no bedrooms, no
floor and no age.

99
00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:52.660
You can think of
this 0.1 as saying

100
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.600
that maybe for every
additional square foot,

101
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.835
the price will increase
by 0.1 $1,000 or by $100,

102
00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.945
because we're saying that
for each square foot,

103
00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:07.900
the price increases by 0.1,

104
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.975
times $1,000, which is $100.

105
00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:15.150
Maybe for each
additional bathroom,

106
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.680
the price increases by

107
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.055
$4,000 and for each
additional floor

108
00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:21.300
the price may increase by

109
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.515
$10,000 and for each additional
year of the house's age,

110
00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:28.650
the price may
decrease by $2,000,

111
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.455
because the parameter
is negative 2.

112
00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:35.760
In general, if you
have n features,

113
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.980
then the model will
look like this.

114
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.300
Here again is the definition

115
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.930
of the model with n features.

116
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.840
What we're going to do next is

117
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.520
introduce a little
bit of notation

118
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.170
to rewrite this expression in

119
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.210
a simpler but equivalent way.

120
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.760
Let's define W as a list of

121
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.000
numbers that list
the parameters W_1,

122
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.590
W_2, W_3,

123
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.925
all the way through W_n.

124
00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:04.960
In mathematics, this
is called a vector

125
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.200
and sometimes to designate
that this is a vector,

126
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.060
which just means a
list of numbers,

127
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.970
I'm going to draw a
little arrow on top.

128
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.895
You don't always have
to draw this arrow

129
00:06:15.895 --> 00:06:19.330
and you can do so or not
in your own notation,

130
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.400
so you can think of
this little arrow as

131
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.425
just an optional signifier

132
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.350
to remind us that
this is a vector.

133
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.260
If you've taken the linear
algebra class before,

134
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.000
you might recognize that this is

135
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.210
a row vector as opposed
to a column vector.

136
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.460
But if you don't know
what those terms means,

137
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.030
you don't need to
worry about it.

138
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.795
Next, same as before,

139
00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:45.100
b is a single number and not
a vector and so this vector

140
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.710
W together with this number b

141
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.360
are the parameters of the model.

142
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.365
Let me also write X as
a list or a vector,

143
00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:59.420
again a row vector that

144
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.030
lists all of the
features X_1, X_2,

145
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.795
X_3 up to X_n,

146
00:07:04.795 --> 00:07:07.530
this is again a vector,

147
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.440
so I'm going to add a little
arrow up on top to signify.

148
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.410
In the notation up on top,

149
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.600
we can also add little
arrows here and here

150
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.660
to signify that
that W and that X

151
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.355
are actually these
lists of numbers,

152
00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:29.835
that they're actually
these vectors.

153
00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:34.750
With this notation, the model
can now be rewritten more

154
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.310
succinctly as f of x equals,

155
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.710
the vector w dot and
this dot refers to

156
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.525
a dot product from linear
algebra of X the vector,

157
00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:50.730
plus the number b.

158
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.190
What is this dot product thing?

159
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.315
Well, the dot products of

160
00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:59.450
two vectors of two lists
of numbers W and X,

161
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.490
is computed by checking

162
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.475
the corresponding
pairs of numbers,

163
00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:09.030
W_1 and X_1 multiplying that,

164
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.540
W_2 X_2 multiplying that,

165
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.525
W_3 X_3 multiplying that,

166
00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:19.080
all the way up to W_n
and X_n multiplying

167
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.340
that and then summing up
all of these products.

168
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.335
Writing that out,

169
00:08:25.335 --> 00:08:32.480
this means that the dot products
is equal to W_1X_1 plus

170
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:41.910
W_2X_2 plus W_3X_3 plus
all the way up to W_nX_n.

171
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:46.810
Then finally we add
back in the b on top.

172
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.410
You notice that this gives us

173
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.080
exactly the same expression
as we had on top.

174
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.490
The dot traffic notation
lets you write the model in

175
00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.240
a more compact form
with fewer characters.

176
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.510
The name for this type of
linear regression model with

177
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.230
multiple input features is
multiple linear regression.

178
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.200
This is in contrast to
univariate regression,

179
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.415
which has just one feature.

180
00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:15.510
By the way, you might think

181
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.400
this algorithm is called
multivariate regression,

182
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.590
but that term actually
refers to something

183
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.170
else that we won't
be using here.

184
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.970
I'm going to refer to this model

185
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.755
as multiple linear regression.

186
00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:31.705
That's it for linear regression
with multiple features,

187
00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.555
which is also called
multiple linear regression.

188
00:09:34.555 --> 00:09:36.495
In order to implement this,

189
00:09:36.495 --> 00:09:39.710
there's a really neat trick
called vectorization,

190
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.040
which will make it much
simpler to implement

191
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.965
this and many other
learning algorithms.

192
00:09:44.965 --> 00:09:47.260
Let's go on to the
next video to take

193
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.770
a look at what is vectorization.
