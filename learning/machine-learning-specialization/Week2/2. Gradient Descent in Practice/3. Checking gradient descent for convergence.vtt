00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.165
When running gradient descent,

2
00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:05.490
how can you tell if
it is converging?

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.740
That is, whether it's
helping you to find

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.020
parameters close to
the global minimum

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.565
of the cost function.

6
00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.560
By learning to recognize what

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.030
a well-running implementation of

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.320
gradient descent looks like,

9
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.630
we will also, in a later video,

10
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.170
be better able to choose a
good learning rate Alpha.

11
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.735
Let's take a look.
As a reminder,

12
00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.565
here's the gradient
descent rule.

13
00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.040
One of the key choices is

14
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.110
the choice of the
learning rate Alpha.

15
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.760
Here's something that
I often do to make

16
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.580
sure that gradient
descent is working well.

17
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.110
Recall that the job of

18
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.690
gradient descent is
to find parameters w

19
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.075
and b that hopefully minimize
the cost function J.

20
00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:49.865
What I'll often do is
plot the cost function J,

21
00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.895
which is calculated
on the training set,

22
00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.460
and I plot the value of J at

23
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.550
each iteration of
gradient descent.

24
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.970
Remember that each
iteration means after

25
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.270
each simultaneous update
of the parameters w and b.

26
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.210
In this plot, the
horizontal axis is

27
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.430
the number of iterations of

28
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.720
gradient descent that
you've run so far.

29
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.055
You may get a curve
that looks like this.

30
00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:22.685
Notice that the horizontal axis

31
00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:24.650
is the number of iterations of

32
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.830
gradient descent and not
a parameter like w or b.

33
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.360
This differs from
previous graphs you've

34
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.570
seen where the
vertical axis was cost

35
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.150
J and the horizontal axis was

36
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.125
a single parameter like w or b.

37
00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:46.130
This curve is also
called a learning curve.

38
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.930
Note that there are

39
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.730
a few different
types of learning

40
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.635
curves used in machine learning,

41
00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:53.315
and you see some of the types

42
00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:55.510
later in this course as well.

43
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.900
Concretely, if you look here
at this point on the curve,

44
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.195
this means that after you've run

45
00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:04.880
gradient descent
for 100 iterations,

46
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.515
meaning 100 simultaneous
updates of the parameters,

47
00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:12.495
you have some learned
values for w and b.

48
00:02:12.495 --> 00:02:16.020
If you compute the cost J, w,

49
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.265
b for those values of w and b,

50
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.995
the ones you got
after 100 iterations,

51
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:25.160
you get this value
for the cost J.

52
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.665
That is this point on
the vertical axis.

53
00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:34.550
This point here corresponds
to the value of J for

54
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.350
the parameters
that you got after

55
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.695
200 iterations of
gradient descent.

56
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:42.965
Looking at this graph
helps you to see

57
00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:44.900
how your cost J changes

58
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.615
after each iteration
of gradient descent.

59
00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:50.150
If gradient descent
is working properly,

60
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.620
then the cost J should

61
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.604
decrease after every
single iteration.

62
00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:58.880
If J ever increases
after one iteration,

63
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.315
that means either Alpha
is chosen poorly,

64
00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.225
and it usually means
Alpha is too large,

65
00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.540
or there could be
a bug in the code.

66
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.280
Another useful thing
that this part can tell

67
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.965
you is that if you
look at this curve,

68
00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:16.805
by the time you reach
maybe 300 iterations also,

69
00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:19.145
the cost J is leveling

70
00:03:19.145 --> 00:03:22.690
off and is no longer
decreasing much.

71
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.950
By 400 iterations,

72
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.740
it looks like the curve
has flattened out.

73
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.700
This means that gradient
descent has more or less

74
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.550
converged because the curve
is no longer decreasing.

75
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.840
Looking at this learning curve,

76
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.180
you can try to spot
whether or not

77
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.005
gradient descent is converging.

78
00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:46.310
By the way, the number

79
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.125
of iterations that
gradient descent

80
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:49.970
takes a conversion can vary

81
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.175
a lot between different
applications.

82
00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:53.840
In one application, it may

83
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.584
converge after just
30 iterations.

84
00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:58.220
For a different application,

85
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.180
it could take 1,000 or
100,000 iterations.

86
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.050
It turns out to be very
difficult to tell in

87
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.405
advance how many iterations

88
00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:10.555
gradient descent
needs to converge,

89
00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:12.710
which is why you can create

90
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.185
a graph like this,
a learning curve.

91
00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:17.360
Try to find out
when you can start

92
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.120
training your particular model.

93
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.900
Another way to decide when
your model is done training

94
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.250
is with an automatic
convergence test.

95
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.805
Here is the Greek
alphabet epsilon.

96
00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:35.710
Let's let epsilon be a

97
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.930
variable representing
a small number,

98
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.220
such as 0.001 or 10^-3.

99
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.970
If the cost J decreases by less

100
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.550
than this number epsilon
on one iteration,

101
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.640
then you're likely on
this flattened part of

102
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.260
the curve that you see on

103
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.105
the left and you can
declare convergence.

104
00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:58.135
Remember, convergence,

105
00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:00.550
hopefully in the case
that you found parameters

106
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.045
w and b that are close to the
minimum possible value of

107
00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:06.850
J. I usually find

108
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.290
that choosing the
right threshold

109
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.195
epsilon is pretty difficult.

110
00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:12.020
I actually tend
to look at graphs

111
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.340
like this one on the left,

112
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.720
rather than rely on
automatic convergence tests.

113
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.860
Looking at the solid
figure can tell you,

114
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.700
I'll give you at some
advanced warning if

115
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.635
maybe gradient descent is not
working correctly as well.

116
00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:29.630
You've now seen what
the learning curve

117
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.450
should look like when gradient
descent is running well.

118
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.300
Let's take these insights
and in the next video,

119
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.500
take a look at how to

120
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.810
choose an appropriate
learning rate.
